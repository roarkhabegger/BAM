# Bootcamp on Astrophysics Methods
## Welcome to a Python introduction for Astrophysicists and Astronomers!

This repository is a set of Jupyter Notebook files introducing you to coding in Python, with examples geared towards modern astrophysics research. 

Before downloading this repository using the green Code button, please follow these steps to setup a Python instanceon your computer. If you already have Python and can read/edit Jupyter Notebooks, feel free to skip these steps and download the code!

## Installing Anaconda
Anaconda is a program which includes the Python coding language along with several useful coding interfaces. Since it is easy to download and get setup, we recommend starting with it as opposed to other (possibly less bulky) Python installation methods.

1. Right click on the following link [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and open it in a new tab. 
Once there, download the installer for your system (it should default to the correct system, but make sure the correct logo for your computer's operating system (Windows, Mac or Linux) appears. 
After downloading, run the installer. 
2. Once you have Anaconda, go ahead and open it. You should see severall apps that you could launch. Find the one titled "CMD.exe Prompt" and launch it.
When it opens up a terminal window, paste or type the following into that terminal: 

        conda install -c numpy astropy scipy matplotlib      
    You may have to type a 'y' into the terminal once it grabs these libraries.

3. Next, go ahead and download this code as a zip file using the green Code button above (or click [this link](https://github.com/roarkhabegger/astrophysicalPython/archive/refs/heads/main.zip))
4. After downloading the zip, unzip it on your computer (in a Documents folder, or some other place where you would like to work).
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) server from the array of icons in Anaconda's home page. 
This should open a browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) where you can see your directory of files. 
Use that directory to navigate to where you unzipped the code from Github.
6. Click on one of the files ending in .ipynb and get started coding when Jupyter opens another tab in your browser!

You are doing great. Best of luck with learning Python!
Feel free to email any of the collaborators on this project if you are having trouble getting Python/Jupyter/Anaconda setup.
